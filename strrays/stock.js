// Suppose we could access yesterday's stock prices as an array, where:

// Write an efficient function that takes stockPricesYesterday and returns the best profit 
// I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday.

// No "shorting"â€”you must buy before you sell. 
// You may not buy and sell in the same time step (at least 1 minute must pass).
